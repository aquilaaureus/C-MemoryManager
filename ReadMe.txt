Hello programmers :)

Purpose
^^^^^^^
Implementing this simple heap relates directly to LO1 for this module, and 
consequently will count as 15 of the 70 marks awarded for direct assessment 
for this module.


SET UP INSTRUCTIONS:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^		    
1)	Get latest on:
	//depot/GamerCamps/Pro2015/Mod_3/TeachingAndLearning/MSc/HeapAssignment/SimpleHeap_Template/

1a) !! DO NOT open the project file SimpleHeap.sln !!

2)	Make a copy of the SimpleHeap_Template folder into the folder 
	//depot/GamerCamps/Pro2016/Mod_3/TeachingAndLearning/MSc/Work/

2a) !! DO NOT open the copied SimpleHeap.sln before checking it in !! 

3)	Right-click on the copy and ensure the read-only checkbox is unchecked

4)	Rename the copied folder to your own firstname.surname

5)	Check in the new folder to perforce


Implementation Goals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The implementational goals should be simple to understand :)

The code in main() that tests CHeap incrementally tests its features as the 
test code goes from top to bottom.

If at any point the test code gets a value it's not expecting then it will 
assert.

The test code is commented as to what it expects the behaviour of CHeap to 
be at each point; you should consider this the specification for CHeap.

The further the test code gets before asserting, the more of the features 
you have (theoretically) successfully implemented.

Consequently, you should not change the test code in main()...

...with the exception that whilst implementing your heap, you should feel 
free to add your own test code in before the official test code in order to 
test your implementation in your own way if you wish.

Please ensure that the test code is put back to normal when you check in

Please bear in mind that since this is assessed:
* I won't be fixing bugs for you, though I will help you find them if 
you're totally stuck.
* You should not be sharing code
* do feel free to discuss your implementation 
or pointing people to reference material or research sources you have found
* if you need help, please talk to me.
* DO NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE!

Good luck!
